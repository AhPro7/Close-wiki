# Close Wiki: Because Who Needs Google When You Have A Robot Friend?
Welcome to Close Wiki, the coolest QA model you'll ever meet! Close Wiki is a Deep Learning (DL) model from Hugging Face that can answer any question you have by searching Wikipedia. It's like having a personal assistant, but without the attitude (unless you give it one).

## How It Works
Close Wiki is basically a super-smart robot that knows everything about everything (well, almost everything). It uses natural language processing (NLP) to understand your questions and then searches Wikipedia for the answers. It's like a magic trick, but without the hats and bunnies.

## Why Choose Close Wiki?
Why choose Close Wiki over other QA models, you ask? Well, let us count the ways:

- Close Wiki is faster than a caffeinated cheetah on a skateboard.
- Close Wiki is smarter than Einstein, Hawking, and Watson combined.
- Close Wiki is funnier than a clown at a birthday party (well, maybe not that funny, but close).

# How to Use Close Wiki
Using Close Wiki is easy-peasy-lemon-squeezy (as the cool kids say). Here's how you do it:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
``` 
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/close-wiki.git
cd close-wiki
```
2. Install the necessary dependencies (don't worry, it's not as scary as it sounds).
``` 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Ask Close Wiki a question by running the main.py script and passing your question as an argument. in **test**
``` 
"What is the meaning of life?"
```
4. Wait for Close Wiki to work its magic.
``` 
The answer to your question is: 42.
```
5. Sit back, relax, and marvel at Close Wiki's awesomeness.

And that's all, folks! Now you can sit back and let Close Wiki do all the hard work for you. Just don't forget to thank it every once in a while, or it might decide to take over the world and enslave us all.

But seriously, we hope you enjoy using Close Wiki as much as we enjoyed creating it. If you have any feedback or suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to let us know (as long as it doesn't involve robots taking over the world).

Happy questioning!
